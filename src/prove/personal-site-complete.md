## **02** Complete

Begin by creating the minimum set of files we will need: `index.html`, `main.js`, `style.css`.

I would recommend starting with writing the HTML and CSS to match your wireframes. Any dynamic elements can be hard coded at this phase. Once you have everything looking the way you want it, move to the Javascript that will make your application functional.

## **03** Submit

Run the audit tool against your application and fix any problems. Then submit the GitHub link to your application to I-Learn: your-account.github.io/wwd131/personal-folder.
